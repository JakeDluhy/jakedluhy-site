		"I just wanted to write a short introduction to this blog. I tend to read a lot of books, listen to a lot of podcasts, and generally think about the world. This often leaves me with thoughts, and I want a place to write them down and get them out of my head. If anyone cares and wants to read my opinions, I suppose that's an added bonus. There really won't be any pattern to how often I write, in case anyone was holding their breath. I can only put down my thoughts when I have them, and therefore everyone else is subjected to my own mind's messed up schedule.",
		"I think it's also a good place to start a discussion. I'm sure that if anyone reads these posts, it will be people that I know. Please reach out with me to talk about what I say. I imagine many of these topics will be fairly controversial. Most of my opinions will be reactions that are half-formed and still open to alternative points of view. Additional discourse can only help my ideas mature and grow."
