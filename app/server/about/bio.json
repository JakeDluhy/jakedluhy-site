		"I'm a student entrepreneur finishing up my final year at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. I originally set out to study Aerospace Engineering, but I found that while I still find the material fascinating, Aero engineering is not the field I want to work in at this point in time. I've fallen in love with the startup culture, and the people and companies that are working to create value out of an idea.",
		"Because of that, I've spent the last year learning all about web development in my free time. By creating side projects, exploring new technologies, and getting hands on experience on the job, I now consider myself quite proficient at building web applications. My goal as I transition out of school is to either start my own company, or find a home at a company where I feel I can add value and help create something great.",
		"That being said, I have many interests outside of programming, and my blog will not only have posts about programming and academia, but also new recipes I'm excited about (I love to cook) or my thoughts and opinions on a variety of subjects (I'm open-minded and very opinionated). I hope you enjoy my corner of the internet!"
